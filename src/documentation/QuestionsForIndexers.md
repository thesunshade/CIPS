# Questions for professional indexers

The following are questions to be answered by professional indexers

## How should cross refs to words with multiple listings be handled?

For example, there are three entries for laziness:

- laziness (alasa, ālasya, anuṭṭhāna)
- laziness (kosajja)
- laziness (kusīta)

If there is going to be an entry for idleness that just points to laziness, should it point to all three? Or just the first one? Or just any of them?
